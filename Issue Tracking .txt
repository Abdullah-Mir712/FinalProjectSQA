Repository Access: To create an issue, the user must have access to the repository where they want to report the issue. Access can be in the form of read-only access (for public repositories) or read-write access (for public or private repositories).

Issue Creation Permissions: Users must have the necessary permissions to create issues in the repository. For public repositories, users with read access can create issues. For private repositories, the repository owners or collaborators can create issues.

Issue Tracker Enabled: The repository must have the issue tracking feature enabled. By default, GitHub enables the issue tracking feature for all repositories. However, repository owners can choose to disable it.

labels and assignees during issue creation or leave them to be set later by maintainers or contributors.
